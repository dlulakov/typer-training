# Typing Speed Trainer (Windows Forms)

A simple Windows Forms desktop application for practicing fast and accurate typing, inspired by Monkeytype.  
The app allows users to take typing tests in English, measure typing speed (WPM) and accuracy, and automatically save results into a `.txt` file. A built-in highscore history helps users track their best performances over time.
